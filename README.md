# SkyLogs: Unified Open Source Alert Management

SkyLogs is an open-source startup on a mission to build a unified observability platform powered by popular open-source tools. We're creating a **wrapper around many well-known observability tools**, integrating them into a single, intuitive panel.

Our first step is launching a centralized **alert management platform** that seamlessly integrates with tools like **Prometheus, Alertmanager, VictoriaMetrics, Grafana, Elasticsearch, Sentry, Splunk**, and more — providing a user-friendly way to manage all alerts from one place.

We're deeply aligned with **DevOps culture**, especially the **shared responsibility** principle. Instead of the infrastructure team being solely responsible for handling all incidents and disasters, SkyLogs allows you to **distribute alerts across your organization**. Alerts can be **personalized and assigned to individual users or teams**, encouraging shared accountability and improving communication. This personalization helps users build a better relationship with alerts, act faster, and ultimately **accelerate incident resolution**.
